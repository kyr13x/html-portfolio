<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Charity is an American transplant now living in the United Kingdom. She's worked in higher education, video games, and publishing. Web development has always fascinated her, and she's looking to pivot deeper into the tech space by learning how to code.</p>

<p>Though she continues to dream of making it as a big-time, smash-hit fiction author, her need for stability, holiday time, and a baseline paycheck inspired her to expand her skill set in ways that might benefit both her writing aspirations and her pocketbook.</p>

<p>She's created this portfolio to practice her coding skills, and prove to herself that she's not too old to learn new tricks, or to move into a new career path.</p>
