<h1>Charity's Favourite Movies Ever</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies to re-watch over and over again</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Lord of the Rings trilogy</h3>
<p>What's not to love? An epic battle of good versus evil, heroes of all types, bibilcal allegory, and the enduring message that even the smallest of us can change the course of the world.</p>

<h3>The Mighty Ducks trilogy</h3>
<p>An underdog story with a ragtag bunch of kids, a coach with a growth arc, and an awesome soundtrack. C'mon now. Bring on the Flying V!</p>

<h3>The Notebook</h3>
<p>Ryan Gosling is one of my favourite actors, ever, and this film is one of the most romantic movies of all time. I can already feel myself swoon.</p>
